# PDM: Pulse Density Modulation Decoder

Author: Jon Nordby, Martin Stensg√•rd

Peripheral index: 10

## What it does

The PDM peripheral outputs a bit clock signal for a PDM microphone,
and decodes the returned density signal into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) words.

|---------|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | ENABLE  | R/W    | Clock gate (0-1).                                                   |
| 0x04    | PERIOD  | R/W    | PDM clock period (0-255).                                           |
| 0x08    | SELECT  | R/W    | PDM data pin number (0-7).                                          |
| 0x0c    | SAMPLE  | R      | PCM sample, result of conversion.                                   |

### ENABLE
Bit 0: Enable clock generation.

### PERIOD
Number of system clock cycles per PDM clock cycle.
For example, to generate a 1 MHz clock signal, set this to 64.

### SELECT
Which input pin to sample data on.

### SAMPLE
16-bit signed integer.
Clears interrupt when read.

## How to test

In this example we generate 15 625 PCM samples per second,
by generating a 1 MHz PDM bit clock,
assuming the microcontroller's clock is running at 14 MHz:

1. Write 14 (cpu clk per pdm clk) to address 4 (CLKP) to set PDM frequency.
2. Write 1 to address 0 (CTRL) to start this peripheral running.
3. Every time this peripheral interrupts, read PCM sample from address 8.
4. Do something interesting with the audio samples! :)
